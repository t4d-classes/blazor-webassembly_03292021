# Exercise 6

1. Fully implement save car and cancel car buttons. When the cancel button is clicked, revert the changes back to the original.

- Hint: Find index of the original, and replace the original at that index.

2. If one of the table rows is being edited, the edit row should change to a view row after, a car is added, or a car is deleted, or a car is saved. For the add or delete operations, the changes for the car being edited should not be saved.
